   ⚠️ **Warning: Protect Your Credentials**

   **Do not share credentials through any repository. Always ensure that before sharing your code or committing changes, 
   all credentials are removed from 'Examples:' tables within feature files and also from [config.env](/config.env) file.
   Protect your sensitive information and avoid sharing it inadvertently.**
 
   **Note: The optimal choice is to include your personal email account in the contacts and enter it into the 'Examples:' 
   tables to avoid sending unsolicited emails to someone else's account.**
