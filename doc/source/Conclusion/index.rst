CONCLUSION
==========

Based on this short project, we can conclude that combining Python, Gherkin, pytest-bdd, and Playwright is a powerful tool for implementing BDD testing.

It is interesting to note that the implementation of pytest-bdd slightly changes the behaviour of fixtures, so developers must be careful when mixing different testing frameworks.

I have only scratched the surface of modern testing applications.

As projects grow, it becomes increasingly important to have custom logging tools, prepare pipelines, and more. However, that is a story for another time.
